## How to journal for Civic Innovation Fellows

On talk.beta.nyc, we have created a private category for you to [journal](https://talk.beta.nyc/c/CIF/2015-Journals). This group is only accessible to fellows and leadership.

*Note, your colleagues will be able to see these topics and engage with you. If you want to reference someone or get their attention, use the @USERNAME.*

For every day you are working, we expect you to take 30 mins and journal about your experience. 

While the above is designed to set the tone of journaling, we want to you to engage in the following questions:

* What am I learning?
* What are the greatest risks?
* If I had to do this part of the project again, what would I do different?
* What can I do to improve my communications?
* What do I enjoy most about this project? 
* Is there an issue or idea I should let the fellowship leadership know? (If this is an issue you want to deal with privately, please note the need and send a private message.)
