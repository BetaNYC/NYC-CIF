# Week 01 - Things you need to do.

1. Setup slack on your smart phone. You can download the slack app via the app stores. When you start the configuration, slack will ask you for a something like 'XXXX.slack.com'. You will need to enter in 'beatnyc.slack.com'.
2. Make a list of Community Boards you want to investigate. [Report back your top three Community Boards](https://talk.beta.nyc/t/which-community-boards-do-you-explore/1570) into this talk.beta.nyc thread.
3. As part of the fellowship, tell us what [locations you want to explore](https://talk.beta.nyc/t/field-trip-ideas/1564).
4. Don't forget to [journal your first week's experience](https://talk.beta.nyc/t/week-01-bootcamp-journals/1562?u=noneck).
5. Start to document a Community Board's digital footprint.
