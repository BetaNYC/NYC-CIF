# Week 01 - Research a Community Board digital presence 

## About this assignment

As part of getting to know a Community Board, we want you to get to know their digital footprint. Though this process, you should find answers to 40% - 60% of these questions. We will be impressed if you can find answers to all questions. 

Over the next week, we want you to search the internet and find answers to these questions. **This assignment is due at close of business on Friday, 2 October**. 

Title the document with 'Community Board 00 - Last Name, First Name'. 00 should be the Community Board number.

Once you have completed your initial research, we will review these answers and may add more questions. Because these will be living documents, we suggest you keep this in a google doc and share the document with 'cif@beta.nyc'.

## Committees 

We need you to make a list of each committee & task force. For example, [CB4 does a great job](http://www.nyc.gov/html/mancb4/html/committees/wpe.shtml) at listing the committees, their members, and the functions of the committee. Not all community boards are that well thought out. 

Your task is to compile a list of the Committees & Task Forces. If you can, compile this list as a table within the same google doc you've been working on.

| Name | Type | URL |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Example: Committee | Committee | http://www.xyz.com |
| Example: Task Force | Task Force | http://www.xyz.com |
