# Week 01 - Research a Community Board digital presence 

## About this assignment

As part of getting to know a Community Board, we want you to get to know their digital footprint. Though this process, you should find answers to 40% - 60% of these questions. We will be impressed if you can find answers to all questions. 

Over the next week, we want you to search the internet and find answers to these questions. **This assignment is due at close of business on Friday, 2 October**. 

Once you have completed your initial research, we will review these answers and may add more questions. Because these will be living documents, we suggest you keep this in a google doc and share the document with 'cif@beta.nyc'.
