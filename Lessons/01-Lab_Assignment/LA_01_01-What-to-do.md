# Week 01 - Things you need to do.

1. Setup slack on your smart phone.
Download the [slack app via the app stores](https://slack.com/downloads). When you start the configuration, slack will ask you for team name or a something like 'XXXX.slack.com'. You will need to enter in 'betanyc.slack.com'. Then, follow up with your user name and passwords.

2. Configure your profiles on Slack and Talk.
A key part to being a good online community member is having a photo. As part of slack and talk.beta.nyc, ensure that you have uploaded a photo with your face.

3. Adopt a Community Board.
For the boot camp, you will adopt one Community Board and develop a detailed analysis of what information it shares with the general public. Find three Community Boards _you_ want to investigate, add them to your first week's journal, and tell us _why_ you want to investigate them.

4. Create a google document!
Following this template (link), create a google document, paste in the template, and share the document with cif@beta.nyc

5. Answer questions about NYC
To prepare you to understand NYC's Government, you need to use resources you have to answer these questions. Please create a google document and share it with cif@beta.nyc

6. JOURNAL
For the time you are with us, you are required to write a weekly journal. Add your first journal entry here â€” [journal your first week's experience](https://talk.beta.nyc/c/CIF/2016-Journal).

This first journal entry should follow the journal template, list the three Community Boards you want to research, a link to the Community Board google document, and a link to a google document with all of the NYC questions.
