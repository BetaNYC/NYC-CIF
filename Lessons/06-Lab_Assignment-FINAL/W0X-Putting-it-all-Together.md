# Week X - Putting it all Together

OK, now that everyone has done a first draft of their Community Board's digital profile, it's time to put it all together. Working with one another, figure out the best way to combine all of your insights into a single document. We want to see what you come up with for a presentation, but the final product should represent your overall insights about every Community Board, using the previous template as a guide. 

## Assignment: 

* For every one of your Boards, based on what you have found online, what would you say are the 3 most important issues facing the Board. 
* Where do they seem to spend the most time/energy, based on what's online?
* What are three things Community Boards can do to improve their digital footprint?

## Friday Group Presentation:

On Friday, 9 October, you will have to do a group presentation and give us two slides.

1. You need to point out (up to three things) what a Community Board is doing well. If you can't point out three well things, point out what they are doing ok.
2. Point out three things that a Community Board can do to improve its digital footprint.
3. Share this google slides with the email address 'cif@beta.nyc' or you can upload it to this [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/a/betanyc.us/folderview?id=0B98QOZfGax93WWhBNU1zSHI5NTg&usp=sharing).
