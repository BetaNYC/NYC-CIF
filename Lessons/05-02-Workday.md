# Getting to know a Community District's data

## Objectives 

For the next few weeks, you will be working on understanding NYC 311 data. This exercise requires you to use Socrata, Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets, and CartoDB. Your task is to make graphs and maps of the following data. This is due on the week of Nov 9. 

To complete this task, create a google doc, answer this questions, and share it with 'cif@beta.nyc'.

Tips on completing the assignment:

1. To complete the seasonal research, you will need to create a filter, select your community district, and then build a date filter between a set of dates. You will have to make a filter per season. Remember to save each filter.

2. To include all events between two days, lets say 1 June to 30 Aug, you will need to select 1 June, 12:00 AM till 30 Aug, 12:00 AM. 

3. When making a pivot table in Excel, you'll want to select "complaint type" and "descriptor" as rows. Then, you'll want to "count" the "unique keys." This will give you a count of every incident type.

 - What are the top 10 complaints per season. Make a table that lists seasons, year, service request, and count. Put this into a google sheets
 - Have your assumptions changed? If so, how? Write them down.

 - Diving into winter 2014 & 2015 data.
   -- What are the differences between the two seasons?
   -- What might be 2016's top 10 issues?
 -- **Note on this: Winter 2015 is the months of Nov 2014-Feb 2015. You should be comparing the 2015 season to the previous year (Nov 13-Feb 14), and then making predictions for this upcoming Winter (2016).**
