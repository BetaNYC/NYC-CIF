### Open Source Essentials
Many authors have chronicled the history of open source and profiled the movement’s most prolific personalities. These are some of the most popular accounts. If we taught a class—call it "Open Source 101"—then this list would be the syllabus.

At opensource.com, our mission is to shine a light on the places where the open source way is magnifying ideas and multiplying effort. And we remain especially interested in topics beyond technology—developments in areas like business, education, government, health, law, and everyday life.

[This collection](http://opensource.com/sites/default/files/open_source_eBook_AnOpenWorld_web.pdf) offers some of our most empowering stories. From the trenches. From the library. From the cubicle. From the capitol. From the classroom and the boardroom and the courtroom. These are our community members—and perhaps you could be in the next edition.

### How to get started with Open Source 
[[source link](http://opensource.com/resources/ebook/how-get-started-open-source)]
Taking the first steps in any journey can be scary. There are new obstacles to hurdle, unfamiliar landscapes to traverse, and usually the destination is shrouded in mystery. But that's also what makes new ventures exciting and worthwhile.

The collection of stories in this eBook are about striking out on the open source way. Whether you're an individual, seeking information on moving away from closed software, or an organization looking for free and open alternatives to the utilities that help your business succeed, these are stories about finding your footing in the world of open source. Several are “origin stories” about how experts discovered open source, and how they've flourished in the time since. Others are focused guides on finding the right software, using a specific open source tool, or introducing your neighborhood or town to the power of the open source way.

Remember that it's not easy to get started with anything new, but, as an old Buddhist saying goes, “It is better to travel well than to arrive.” We hope these stories will help you travel well along the open source way, and keep you traveling for years to come.

### Open always wins: A Michael Tiemann collection 
[[source Link](http://opensource.com/resources/ebook/open-always-wins)]
Michael Tiemann is Vice President of Open Source Affairs at Red Hat and former President of the Open Source Initiative. He has written many articles for Opensource.com speaking to the power of the open source way, and part of his process has been to highlight the great ideas of others.

From his introduction:

Linus Pauling famously said “The best way to have a great idea is to have lots of ideas.” This is easier said than done, for many reasons. For me, the foremost reason is that nobody wants to be known for having a dumb idea, so we self-edit. If we self-edit too much, we end up having not a lot of ideas, so having a great idea becomes nearly impossible.

A second challenge is creating a space where ideas can combine, coalesce, catalyze, evolve, and, if they are truly great ideas, crystalize. Is that best space an isolated office where the mind of a lone genius can evaluate all and choose correctly the One Best Idea? Or is it better to open up the process to a diverse set of perspectives, up to and including every possible stakeholder in the outcome?

Glean insight from a true open source visionary and learn how can you apply those principles to your business, career, life, hobbies, and more with this eBook.

### Applying open source principles to government 
[[source link](http://opensource.com/resources/ebook/opengov)]
At opensource.com, we look at the intersection of open source and government, with a special focus on the ways governments adopt and release new technologies and can cultivate open source communities. We document the way that open source principles—participation, transparency, collaboration, sharing, meritocracy, community, and rapid prototyping—have enormous value beyond the technology sector. Citizen movements around open voting, the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request tracking, and even crowdsourced legislation, represent a growing trend of open source principles within government.

Download the free eBookThis collection features stories about government initiatives around the world, from the first two years of opensource.com. They illustrate the impact of open source on government and vice versa. There is a long journey left and we hope you'll share your experiences with us.
