### Communication

**Most important tool!**

We expect you to act like adults and manage people's expectations. This includes: 
* Under promising, over delivering. 
* Being honest about what you know and what you don't know. 
* Being on-time to events or locations. If you're running late, let someone know.
* Being respectful of others feelings, capacity, and abilities.
* Always, have someone review your written work. Never communicate to a large audience without someone looking at what you are trying to say.

Through this program, you are expected to help each other out. If you don't know something, google it. If you still can't figure it out, ask a colleague. If the two of you can't figure it out in five mins, ask a supervisor. Being able to triage a situation, and or find help are critical life and employment skills.

We will be using a number of tools for [asynchronous communication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asynchronous_communication). While working for the Civic Innovation Fellowship, you are expected to use talk.beta.nyc, github, and slack as your primary forums. 98% of the issues, problems, questions you will have should be addressed in the open; in a collaborative manner.

### Bootcamp Break Down


This will be the first 12 weeks of work. This program is broken down in three phases.

 1. Intro to Government
 2. Tools and the civic hacking "practice"
 3. Data acquisition and mapmaking

Over these three phases you will be challenged to profile one district, create maps, document personas, and tell data driven stories.

### Field work

Starting in the new year, you will be deployed to Community Board District Offices. There, you will work for the Community Board and the District Manager. Your task is to assist in their needs, observe, and journal opportunities for improvement.
