### Bootcamp

This will be the first six weeks of work. This program is broken down in three phases.

 1. Intro to Government
 2. Tools and the civic hacking "practice"
 3. Data acquisition and mapmaking

Over these three phases you will be challenged to profile one district, create maps, document personas, and tell data driven stories. 

### Field work

Starting week seven, you will be deployed to Community Board District Offices. There, you will work for the Community Board and the District Manager. Your task is to assist in their needs, observe, and journal opportunities for improvement. Should you be called upon to develop data insights, you will work in a team to develop maps and visualizations.

#### Monthly Check ins 

Every Friday, we will host a SCRUM session where you will talk about what you accomplished the in the last week and what you plan to accomplish and what are your blockers.

One Friday a month, we will gather in person or go on a field trip in NYC.
