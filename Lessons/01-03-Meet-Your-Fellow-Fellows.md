## Effective Icebreaker 

Whenever you walk into an environment, you should try to find out who else is in the room. 

*One of my favorite icebreakers is called "My People." Here's how it works*. - [Kelli Klein writing for the New Organizing Institute](http://archive.neworganizing.com/contentblog/tip-using-effective-icebreakers)

* **You introduce yourself with name, organization, and job title**.
* **You say three communities or types of people you identify with**. For example, I might say, "My peoples are organizers, Harry Potter geeks, and Packers fans."
* **Set a consistent example** by having a second person who's familiar with the exercise go next.
* **Rinse and repeat**. Go around the room and have each person do the same until everyone's done the exercise.

## Getting to know each other

We're going to start by sitting in a circle and have a speakers totem.

* Where do you live?
* Who is your favorite political / elected official?
* What are your hopes, fears, and expectations? ([link](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newLDR_76.htm))
* If you could have dinner with 5 people, who would you have dinner with? 
*Dinner plans: Have each person complete the following sentence; “if I could have dinner with any person, living or dead, it would be, ￼ because* “
* What is your favorite point in New York City's history?
* What are the issues you are facing in your home communities?
* What are your values?
 - Quality of life things
 - Housing
 - Education
 - Food
 - Adventures
