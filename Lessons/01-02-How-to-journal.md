# How to Journal


## Why you need to journal  

Journaling is a part of [the Lean Start up method](http://theleanstartup.com/principles) and is an important step in project management and your own personal development. Journaling has a unique way of creating time and space for you to reflect on what issues you *have addressed*; issues that you *could address*; issues you *should address*. Consider this time your daily safe space.

From a manager's perspective, we need you to journal because we can not keep track of everyone of your projects and issues.


## Steps to journaling

   - Places you visited
 1. Reward yourself


## How to journal for Civic Innovation Fellows

**On talk.beta.nyc, we have created a private category for you to [journal](https://talk.beta.nyc/c/CIF/2015-Journals). This group is only accessible to fellows and leadership**.

Your colleagues will be able to see these topics and engage with you. If you want to reference someone or get their attention, use the `@USERNAME`.

Our platform, [discourse](http://www.discourse.org) / [talk.beta.nyc](https://talk.beta.nyc), uses a lightweight markup language. We encourage you to learn [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) as it is the “common language” of github.*

**Cheat sheets on Markdown**
 * [Super quick](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
 * [DaringFireball’s holy grail](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax)

For every day you work, we expect you to take 30 mins and journal about your experience.

**We want to you to engage in the following questions**:

* What am I learning?
* What are the greatest risks?
* If I had to do this part of the project again, what would I do different?
* What can I do to improve my communications?
* What do I enjoy most about this project?
* Is there an issue or idea I should let the fellowship leadership know? (If this is an issue you want to deal with privately, please note the need and send a private message.)
