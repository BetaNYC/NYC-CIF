# Welcome New York Civic Innovation Fellows!

You are the future! Over the next six months we will unpack a number of issues that affect our local communities. Your job is to observe, empathize, and outline how these problems can be addressed. 

Through this program, you are joining the Manhattan Borough President, Hon. Gale A. Brewer (MBPO) and BetaNYC to empower Manhattan Community Boards with human centered design principles and 21st Century tools to improve the lives of those who touch the Borough of Manhattan. 

Collectively, we recognize the unique potential for technology, namely big data, to improve the way that government interacts with its citizenry, and to enable better decision making. For six months, you will be assigned to a Manhattan Community Board and partner with Community Board Members. Together, you will be challenged to outline problems, design solutions, and build lightweight maps and tools. 

As part of this program, we will educate you while demystifying government technology and sharing NYC open data best practices. This program you will learn off the shelf mapping tools; federal, state and municipal open data resources; gain an introduction to software development philosophies; software development tools; and gain invaluable leadership training.

This program is designed to support the goals of Mayor de Blasio’s 2015 Open Data Plan, namely the mission of making “[Open Data for All](http://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/487-15/de-blasio-administration-releases-open-data-all-city-s-new-open-data-plan).” Working with NYC Community Boards and related community organizations, we will bring open data decision making to neighborhood government, while bringing in new perspectives on how to improve data publication and presentation from government.
