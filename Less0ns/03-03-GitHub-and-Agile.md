## About GitHub
'to be completed'

## Markdown

As you have learned in the "How to Journal" chapter, Markdown is a super easy to use format for writing text. GitHub supports Markdown in its issues or you can create a formatted "text" file by using the .MD extension. 


## GitHub Issues
This is like twitter but for task management. 

Service Level Agreement (SLA) - Unless it is a holiday or weekend, all tickets should be reviewed with in 24 hours.

## How to write an issue 

There are two ways to use github to track your work. First, you will need to log in to github or authorize github to use waffle.io.

* via [github/betanyc/NYC-CIF-2015](https://github.com/BetaNYC/NYC-CIF-2015/issues). GitHub's default ticking system is a universal ticket tracking system.

* [waffle.io](https://waffle.io/BetaNYC/NYC-CIF-2015) is a [kanban](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban_board) version of github issues. Waffle.io fully integrates into GitHub's API and makes github issues super easy to use. We're not kidding, this is the EASEST way to track what you *need to do*, what you *are doing*, and what *is done*!

### Ticket status

By default, github's ticket tracking has two state open and done, i.e. closed.

Waffle.io enables you to set multiple states and then prioritize those tickets. 

For this project, we're going to use the following states.

 - Backlog (this is a natural state of an opened ticket.)
 - Ready
 - In Progress
 - Done (this is a natural state for a closed ticket.)
