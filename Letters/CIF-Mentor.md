# Apply to be a NYC Civic Innovation Fellowship Mentor

Manhattan Borough President and BetaNYC are seeking 20 - 30 senior designers, technologists, NYC open data scientists, and mapmakers to mentor a group of City University of New York students who are a part of [CUNY's Service Corp](). For the next two semesters, these students will use human centered design principals to explore how Manhattan's Community Boards can better use open data, grow their digital inclusion practice, and  incorporate maps into their decision making process.

Through this program, CUNY students will study how Community Boards use existing technology, outline opportunities for future development, provide administrative support for community boards and their meetings, and crunch NYC's open data into maps and visualizations.


## Mentorship Responsibilities 

 * Host in-person or virtual office hours. We are looking for mentors to free up two to four hours a month. Through this process, you will help CUNY students think though their problems, outline potential solutions, and provide general advice. You might be invited to speak in front of the students.

 * Slack.Beta.NYC -- We will host a special fellows/mentors slack channel for CUNY students to engage in realtime discussions. This is part of the larger BetaNYC community. If you are already a member, you will be added to this private group. Mentors will be expected to have an account and engage with students or the general BetaNYC discussion group.

 * Talk.Beta.NYC -- In addition to slack, students will engage with each other and mentors via a private discussion forum. Mentors are encouraged to have active accounts and engage in conversations.

 * GitHub -- Some students might opt to use GitHub issues to track their progress. Mentors will be encouraged to collaborate and use github issues.
